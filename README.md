# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide is to help in the learning process of how to build a webpage, primarily using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The process was done in a structured manner through git to track issues and tasks, just like a webpage would be built in the real world. Although this page solves no problems, it may aid in remembering some of the most important points of development in the mentioned areas. 

## Installation

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used in two different ways. First, the user can review the topics one at a time, top to bottom. Since each section is clearly separated and contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, the top to bottom review is simple and straightforward. Second, the user can open the DevTools console which allows them to see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned from the prework and it will choose one topic for the user to study first.
